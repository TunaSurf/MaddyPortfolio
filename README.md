# MaddyPortfolio

Basic landing page I designed for my friend Madeline Evans, a local meteorologist. Kept simple, meant to serve as a culmination of links to her work related social media accounts. Includes an Instagram feed at the bottom of the page. Instagram feed currently shows photos from my account as instagram's API requires permissions to pull other account photos which I did not I have.
